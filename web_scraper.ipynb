Brock Purdy (elbow) got hurt early for San Francisco, and Philly simply didn't need to throw the ball much after that. Smith's 29-yard catch on the Eagles' opening drive was the longest play of the game for either team, however, and set up a six-yard score for Miles Sanders. It still resulted in Smith's lowest yardage total since Week 9, but he and the rest of the Eagles passing game should be a lot busier two weeks from now in the Super Bowl. Brown caught four of eight targets for 28 yards in Sunday's 31-7 win over the 49ers in the NFC Championship Game. The Eagles' passing game never had to ramp it up, as Brock Purdy (elbow) got hurt early for the Niners and their offense struggled with journeyman Josh Johnson (concussion) under center. As a result, Brown had a second straight quiet playoff performance after reaching at least 70 yards in six straight games to close out the regular season. The hip issue that's slowed the fourth-year wideout in practice lately may have also been a factor, but Brown will have two weeks to heal up before the Super Bowl. Goedert caught five of six targets for 23 yards in Sunday's 31-7 win over the 49ers in the NFC Championship Game. It wasn't a big performance by any means, but the tight end's five receptions actually led the Eagles in a game where they didn't need to throw the ball much after the loss of Brock Purdy (elbow) derailed the Niners' offense. Goedert has a 10-81-1 line on 11 targets through two playoff games this season, and he figures to have a solid floor with some upside potential in two weeks during the Super Bowl. Sanders carried the ball 11 times for 42 yards and two touchdowns and caught his only target for three yards in Sunday's 31-7 win over the 49ers. San Francisco's offense fell apart after Brock Purdy (elbow) got hurt, leading to a fairly easy win for Philly and a ground-heavy attack fueled by Sanders TDs in the first and second quarters. Kenneth Gainwell actually ended up leading the Eagles in rushing yards, but he saw most of his touches once the game was out of reach. The scores were Sanders' first since Week 14, and he figures to be a key part of the team's game plan Feb. 12 in the Super Bowl. Hurts completed 15 of 25 passes for 121 yards and added 39 rushing yards and a touchdown on 11 carries in Sunday's 31-7 win over the 49ers in the NFC Championship Game. What seemed like it would be a fearsome battle turned into a rout after the Niners lost Brock Purdy to an elbow injury early in the game and was forced to turn to journeyman Josh Johnson (concussion) under center. As a result, the Eagles didn't really need to air it out at all, and all four of the team's TDs came on the ground. Hurts picked up one of them on a one-year run late in the third quarter, but otherwise didn't need to do too much. The low passing numbers could give rise to questions about the health of his elbow, but with two weeks to rest before the Super Bowl, Hurts should be 100 percent as Philly tries to win its second title in six years. Dickerson was unable to return to Sunday's NFC Championship Game against the 49ers after exiting with a left elbow injury in the second half, Jeff McLane of The Philadelphia Inquirer reports. Dickerson was seen with a brace on his left elbow following Sunday's victory, and it's not yet clear whether his injury will impact his status for Super Bowl LVII on Feb. 12. If he's unavailable, Andre Dillard is a candidate to see increased playing time for Philadelphia. \\n                        No ticket information available.\\n                     © 2004-2023 CBS Interactive.
